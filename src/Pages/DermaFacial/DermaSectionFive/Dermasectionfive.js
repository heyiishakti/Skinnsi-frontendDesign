                        <p>Dermafacial is absolutely painless. There’s no abrasion, needling or<br />
                            pinching. The facial is just want you want it to be – relaxing,<br />
                            comfortable and pleasant. Wait, did we say relaxing?</p>

                        <p className='sectionFiveDaltTwoP'>Everyone’s got a different skin type (duh right! But
                            guess the salons<br /> didn’t get the memo). Everyone
                            needs a facial specific to their skin<br /> type. And we do
                            that with dermafacial, unlike salon facials with their<br />
                            one-size-fits-all motto. Our expert dermatologist will
                            calibrate the<br /> facial according to your unique needs,
                            and voila, you will get skin<br /> that’ll invite one
                            compliment after another.
