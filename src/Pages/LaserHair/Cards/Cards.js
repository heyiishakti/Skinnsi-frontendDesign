                      <p>"My therapist Jamna is just great in 
                          her job. It was my second session for
                          full body hair removal. She made me
                          feel sooo comfortable and relaxed. 
                          Jamna really is very kind and soft 
                          spoken and helped me alot with my 
                          skin's acne issues as well. 
                          Throughout the session she made
                          sure I wasn't experiencing any 
                          discomfort. I did not feel any pain 
                          and literally slept while the session
                          thanks to painless hair removal and 
                          Jamna's expertise. Skin feels so soft 
                          and smooth now. Thank you so  
                          much Also, she take utmost care 
                          with respect to corona protocol.
                          Proper hygiene and safety were maintained.
                          She consulted  the dermatologist as 
                          well before starting the process 
                          and changed the machine temperature, etc.

                          I was very impressed. My therapist
                          was Roma. She was well mannered, polite,
                          supportive and made me feel comfortable
                          throughout the session.She was very informative
                          about the procedure and explained the process
                          very well and answered all my questions patiently.
                          And took all COVID safety measures.</p>

                          Both of them were polite and professional.<br/>
                          They have emphasised the need for aftercare
                          in both sessions which I highly appreciate.
                          Have done the treatment from Kaya skin
                          clinic earlier but would definitely
                          recommend skinnsi instead of Kaya now. 
                          Hopefully Iâ€™ll see results soon!<br/>

                          did laser hair removal. Saba made
                          sure i was very comfortable and
                          didnt feel any pain. The procedure
                          was done in about 4&1/2 hours, it
                          wasnt rushed or anything. Totally
                          recommend skinnsi for laser hair
